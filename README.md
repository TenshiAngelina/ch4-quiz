# <Code Quiz>

## Description

My motivation to develop this app was because I wanted to both practice JavaScript basics and have a place to review what I have learned so far. I learned how to use Local Storage and timers.

### User Story

AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
